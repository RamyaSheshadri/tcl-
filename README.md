# Basic Tool Command Language Scripts: <br>
## Authored by Ramya, ECE student at BMSCE, passionate about tool automation, chip design, and making scripts do the heavy lifting.
* This repository contains a curated set of TCL scripts written to simulate common tasks in VLSI design automation, inspired by real tool flows like Synopsys PrimeTime and Design Compiler.<br>
* Scripts automate processes like slack analysis, area/power reporting, batch simulations, clock constraint generation, and more ‚Äî all with beginner-friendly, readable TCL logic.<br>
* Ideal for EDA beginners, STA learners, and anyone looking to get hands-on with scripting in a VLSI context.<br>



# 1.A mini script to simulate checking timing for multiple modules

## WHY THIS SCRIPT IS IMPORTANT
* Mimics real PrimeTime behavior: Generates human-readable reports
* Saves time: Instead of manually opening huge .rpt files, this gives quick results
* Customizable: Can plug into more advanced flows ‚Äî e.g., calculate slack %, add colored logs, send alerts

### How it Would Be Used in a Team Setting
* Let‚Äôs say a team is testing 10 IP blocks (e.g., UART, ALU, memory controller).
After STA is run, this script could:<br>
  - Pull the slack data (or use dummy values like here) <br>
  - Generate a clean summary (timing_report.txt)<br>
  - Let engineers know if any block is unsafe to tape-out<br>

### Script:
set modules [list alu control datapath uart]

### Simulate some fake slack values
set slack_values [list 0.25 -0.12 0.05 0.00]

### Create a report file
set fp [open "timing_report.txt" "w"]
puts $fp "Timing Report"
puts $fp "--------------"

### Loop through modules and write timing info
for {set i 0} {$i < [llength $modules]} {incr i} { <br>
    set mod [lindex $modules $i]  <br>
    set slack [lindex $slack_values $i]  <br>
    
    if {[expr $slack < 0]} {
        set status "VIOLATED"
    } else {
        set status "PASS"
    }

    puts $fp [format "%-10s : Slack = %5.2f ns ‚Üí %s" $mod $slack $status]
}

close $fp
puts "Timing report generated!"

# 2.Renaming report files with timestamps
Imagine you're running a flow, and every time you generate a new report, you want it to be saved with the current date/time so it doesn't overwrite the old one.
### Importance of This Script
* Prevents overwriting old reports üßæ
* Automatically saves each run with a unique timestamp
* Helps track design progress across multiple runs
* Useful in debugging and comparisons (‚Äúwhat changed since last run?‚Äù)
* Makes log management clean and professional

### Where is it used?
- In regression testing, where designs are simulated or analyzed repeatedly, each report is saved with a unique timestamp to track what changed in each run.
- It‚Äôs also essential for log management, helping engineers keep a clean history of reports, debug issues, and compare outputs between different tool versions or synthesis iterations.
- Finally, during signoff and debugging, timestamped reports help verify that no timing or power regressions occurred across runs ‚Äî making it easier to spot where things broke.



üíª TCL Script: Auto-Rename Report with Timestamp
#### Get current time as YYYYMMDD_HHMM
set time_stamp [clock format [clock seconds] -format "%Y%m%d_%H%M"]

#### Create a report name using the timestamp
set report_name "timing_report_$time_stamp.txt"

#### Open the file for writing
set fp [open $report_name "w"]

#### Sample content
puts $fp "Timing Report Generated on: $time_stamp"
puts $fp "-----------------------------------"

#### Dummy module list
set mods [list alu fifo uart]

#### Write dummy slack values
foreach mod $mods {
    set slack [expr rand() * 0.3 - 0.1]  ;
#### Random slack between -0.1 and +0.2
    if {[expr $slack < 0]} {
        set status "VIOLATED"
    } else {
        set status "PASS"
    }
    puts $fp [format "%-8s : Slack = %5.2f ns ‚Üí %s" $mod $slack $status]
}

#### Close the file
close $fp

#### Print result
puts "Report saved as: $report_name"

# 3.Module Area Summary (TCL only, tool-style)

## This script:
### Loops through modules,assigns fake area values,prints a clean area report.
### Importance:
In real VLSI design workflows, every module (e.g., ALU, mux, register, memory controller) consumes a certain **physical area** on the chip.  
Before physical design (floorplanning), engineers need an **area estimate** to:
- Plan chip layout
- Allocate space to each module
- Check which blocks are area-heavy (like XL)
- Optimize large modules to reduce die size and cost

This script gives a **quick simulation** of that behavior ‚Äî helpful for **project summaries, floorplanning, and mock tool outputs**.

### üõ†Ô∏è Where It‚Äôs Used:
- **Synthesis Output Review** ‚Äì to assess area usage after RTL synthesis  
- **Floorplanning Preparation** ‚Äì to classify modules based on size  
- **RTL Optimization** ‚Äì identify area-heavy blocks that need rework  
- **Automation Flows** ‚Äì build quick logs before real tool run

---

#### List of modules (block names)
set modules [list alu decoder mux register memory]

#### Assign random area values to each module (between 500 and 3000 units)
puts "Module Area Report"
puts "-------------------"

foreach mod $modules {
    set area [expr int(rand() * 2500 + 500)]  ;
#### random int between 500‚Äì3000
#### Categorize by area size
    if {$area > 2500} {
        set tag "XL"
    } elseif {$area > 1500} {
        set tag "L"
    } elseif {$area > 1000} {
        set tag "M"
    } else {
        set tag "S"
    }

#### Print result
    puts [format "%-10s : Area = %4d units ‚Üí Size: %s" $mod $area $tag]
}

# 4.Power Report Generator
This script designed to simulate and generate power consumption reports for various system modules. 
The script is useful for system designers, embedded engineers, and hardware architects to assess and categorize the power usage of different components in a system design.

**Purpose & Importance**
* **Power Analysis in Hardware Design**:In embedded systems,simulates power consumption for different hardware modules like ALUs, decoders, multiplexers, etc. It helps in evaluating the power efficiency of each module, which is crucial in designs where power optimization is important, such as low-power devices, IoT systems, and portable electronics.

* **Power Estimation in Simulation:** During hardware simulations, it can be useful for generating random power values to check how various power consumption levels affect overall system performance. This is especially important when power usage is a factor in simulations for mobile devices, FPGAs, and ASICs.

* **System Optimization:** The categorization of modules based on power consumption (Low, Medium, High) helps designers identify modules that are consuming excessive power. This can guide optimizations like scaling back power-hungry components or optimizing power states.

* **Report Generation:** This script produces clear, formatted reports that make it easy to visualize and analyze power usage, helping with documentation, project tracking, and design reviews.

#### List of modules
set modules [list alu decoder mux register memory]

#### Print report header
puts "Module Power Report"
puts "--------------------"

#### Loop through each module
foreach mod $modules {
#### Generate random power between 0.05 and 2.5
    set power [expr rand() * 2.45 + 0.05]

#### Categorize power level
    if {$power < 0.5} {
        set level "Low"
    } elseif {$power < 1.5} {
        set level "Medium"
    } else {
        set level "High"
    }

#### Print formatted result
    puts [format "%-10s : Power = %4.2f W ‚Üí %s" $mod $power $level]
}


#### Sample Output:
#### Module Power Report
--------------------
alu        : Power =  0.42 W ‚Üí Low  <br> 
decoder    : Power =  1.36 W ‚Üí Medium  <br> 
mux        : Power =  2.22 W ‚Üí High<br> 
register   : Power =  1.01 W ‚Üí Medium<br> 
memory     : Power =  0.17 W ‚Üí Low<br> 

# 5.Voltage source names
set lines [list VDD1 VDD2 VDD3 VDD4 VDD5]

puts "Voltage Monitor Report"
puts "------------------------"

foreach line $lines {
#### Generate random voltage between 0.5V and 1.5V
    set voltage [expr rand() + 0.5]

#### Decide status
    if {$voltage < 0.9} {
        set status "Under-voltage"
    } elseif {$voltage <= 1.2} {
        set status "Normal"
    } else {
        set status "Over-voltage"
    }

#### Print result
    puts [format "%-5s : %.3f V ‚Üí %s" $line $voltage $status]
}

Output:
Voltage Monitor Report
------------------------
VDD1  : 0.812 V ‚Üí Under-voltage <br> 
VDD2  : 1.153 V ‚Üí Normal <br> 
VDD3  : 1.391 V ‚Üí Over-voltage <br> 
VDD4  : 1.008 V ‚Üí Normal <br> 
VDD5  : 0.743 V ‚Üí Under-voltage <br> 


# 6.Log Parser Script
## GOAL:
Read a .rpt file, look for specific words (like ‚ÄúVIOLATED‚Äù) and print those lines. <br>
üíª Script:
#### Sets the filename to a variable
set log "timing_report.txt" 

#### Opens the file in read mode
set fp [open $log r]

####  Reads the file content, splits it line-by-line into a list
set lines [split [read $fp] "\n"]

#### Closes the file 
close $fp

#### Prints a header to make output clean
puts "Violations Found:"
foreach line $lines {
    if {[string match *VIOLATED* $line]} {
        puts $line
    }
}
 #### Loops through each line
 If the line contains the word ‚ÄúVIOLATED‚Äù ‚Üí print it!
#### Used in: PrimeTime, DC, Questa logs

# 7.Constraint Generator Script (SDC)

## GOAL:
Auto-generate clock constraints for multiple ports. <br>
üíª Script:
#### List of all clock ports in your design
set clk_ports [list clk1 clk2]
foreach clk $clk_ports {
    puts "create_clock -name $clk -period 10 [get_ports $clk]"
}
#### For each clock:Create a command that tools like PrimeTime use
#### Generates this:
create_clock -name clk1 -period 10 [get_ports clk1]
create_clock -name clk2 -period 10 [get_ports clk2]
#### Used to automate writing .sdc files in STA/Synthesis


### üéØ WHY IS THIS USED? <br>
i.This script auto-generates clock constraints for all clock ports.<br>
ii.In the VLSI flow, you don‚Äôt just write Verilog and simulate it.<br>
 You also need to tell the tools:<br>
‚ÄúHey, this port is a clock.‚Äù<br>
‚ÄúIts period is 10 ns.‚Äù<br>
‚ÄúConnect this constraint to this port.‚Äù<br>
This is done using an SDC file (Synopsys Design Constraints).<br>

#### So this script is used when:
You have many clocks (10+ clk ports)
You don‚Äôt want to write create_clock lines manually <br>
You want to avoid typos or inconsistent period values<br>
You‚Äôre working in a team and need repeatable constraints across runs<br>

#### Real Industry Scenario:
Imagine you‚Äôre in a company and your chip has:
clk_sys, clk_usb, clk_audio, clk_uart, clk_camera<br>

#### Instead of writing:<br>
create_clock -name clk_sys -period 10 [get_ports clk_sys]<br>
create_clock -name clk_usb -period 10 [get_ports clk_usb]<br>
...

#### You use:
set clks [list clk_sys clk_usb clk_audio clk_uart clk_camera]<br>
foreach clk $clks {<br>
    puts "create_clock -name $clk -period 10 [get_ports $clk]"<br>
}
üí• BOOM ‚Äî all 5 lines generated in 1 loop!
